## Samanyu — grid_gen.py + agent.py (Ex1) + visualizer.py + main.py (Ex1) + Testing

### grid_gen.py

- [ ] generate_unique_path(rows, cols): random walk from (0,0) to anchor1 to anchor2 to (M-1,N-1)
- [ ] Anchor1 picked in top-left quadrant (row 1 to rows//2-1, col 1 to cols//2-1)
- [ ] Anchor2 picked in bottom-right quadrant (row rows//2 to rows-2, col cols//2 to cols-2)
- [ ] Anchor1 and anchor2 have different rows AND different columns
- [ ] Anchor1 and anchor2 are not adjacent (abs diff greater than 1 in both row and col)
- [ ] Random walk uses ~30% noise deviation to ensure unique path every run
- [ ] Combine segments: start to anchor1, anchor1 to anchor2, anchor2 to goal
- [ ] Deduplicate path cells while preserving order
- [ ] place_hazards_on_path(): exactly 2 Volcanoes + 2 Waters placed on path cells
- [ ] Same-type hazards are not adjacent to each other on the path
- [ ] Hazards never placed on start, goal, or anchor cells
- [ ] All remaining path cells set to Land (L)
- [ ] Fill non-path cells: 50% hazard (W/V), 40% Land, 10% Brick
- [ ] generate_grid() returns: grid (2D list), path (list), anchor1, anchor2
- [ ] grid[0][0] = START and grid[M-1][N-1] = GOAL always enforced

## Dhanush — agent.py (Ex2) + visualizer.py (Ex2) + main.py (Ex2) + Testing

### agent.py — Exercise 2

- [ ] BeliefCell class: stores P(V), P(W), P(L), P(B) for one cell
- [ ] Initialize BeliefCell priors: P(V) = 0.24, P(W) = 0.24, P(L) = 0.16, P(B) = 0.36
- [ ] risk() method: returns P(V) + P(W)
- [ ] bayesian_update(thermal, seismic): multiply P(T|type) x P(S|type) x prior then normalize
- [ ] scan_count tracked per cell, incremented on each scan
- [ ] blocked flag: set True when scan_count >= MAX_SCANS_PER_CELL (4)
- [ ] last_thermal and last_seismic readings stored in BeliefCell for visualization
- [ ] NoisySensor class: generates noisy True/False using CPT from config.py
- [ ] thermal(true_type): random.random() < P_THERMAL_GIVEN[true_type]
- [ ] seismic(true_type): random.random() < P_SEISMIC_GIVEN[true_type]
- [ ] OracleAgentEx2 class: initializes full 2D belief map (rows x cols of BeliefCell)
- [ ] scan_cell(r,c): reads noisy sensors, calls bayesian_update, costs +1 Turn, agent does NOT move
- [ ] scan_cell returns None and sets blocked if scan_count >= 4
- [ ] should_scan(r,c): returns True if risk > RISK_THRESHOLD and scan_count < 4
- [ ] get_safe_neighbors(r,c): scans risky neighbors before adding to options, sorted by risk ascending
- [ ] probabilistic_a_star(): A* with risk-weighted cost, state = (position, lives)
- [ ] Risk penalty in A*: adds risk x 3 to movement cost for uncertain cells
- [ ] run() method Ex2: executes path, discovers true types on arrival, updates beliefs to 100%
- [ ] Simulation log: same as Ex1 log plus beliefs field = full belief map snapshot per step
- [ ] Scan log format per scan: cell, thermal, seismic, beliefs, scan_num

### visualizer.py — Exercise 2 additions

- [ ] Ex2 uses the same grid generated in the Ex1 portion of main.py

### Testing — Dhanush

- [ ] After every Bayesian update, confirm P(V) + P(W) + P(L) + P(B) = 1.0
- [ ] Manually compute one Bayesian update by hand and verify code matches
- [ ] Test: Thermal=True, Seismic=False → P(V) should be highest (~71%)
- [ ] Test: Thermal=False, Seismic=False → P(B) should be highest (Wall hint from assignment)
- [ ] Test: Thermal=False, Seismic=True → P(W) should be highest
